# DefectPX

**Note:** DefectPX is a legacy application. It was released in 2008 and has been superseded by [InjuredPixels](https://www.aurelitec.com/injuredpixels).

[DefectPX](https://www.aurelitec.com/defectpx/) allows you to easily check for dead or defective pixels on LCD monitors. You can use it to test a new LCD monitor before purchasing, or an already purchased monitor during the warranty period (you may get a replacement according to the manufacturer's dead pixel policy).

A defective (dead or stuck) pixel is a pixel that does not illuminate properly or does not display the correct color output. It usually looks like an annoying black, white or colored spot on your screen.

DefectPX fills the entire screen with one of the colors that make up a pixel, allowing you to inspect the screen for pixels that do not match the selected color. DefectPX is easy to use and it has a very intuitive interface.

DefectPX can be run directly without having to install it on your computer: just download and run.
